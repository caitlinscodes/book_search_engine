# Caitlin Stevenson|Book Search Engine Assignment

## Objectives

In this project, I modified key files within the provided Book Search Engine to transfer the application from a using RESTful APIs to GRAPHQL. Our instructor provided some additional code to support us in successfully transitioning the web application. While I was able to get the application to run locally through /graphql I was unable to deploy the application to Heroku using AtlasDB.
